# Answers to Lab 1 
This README file contains answers to Lab 1. 

3. In the initial condition, the energy per particle starts at 1.2e10 and quickly reaches 0.0 near 10,000 steps. Additionally, the production simulation generates a rdf which represents something in a liquid phase as there is a peak but as the distance increases the intensity of the peak decreases. The 3D visualization of the system shows particles that are diseresed but not are somewhat closer together. In the secon scenario, running the equilibration yields a single dot  which has an energy of 5.3e10. The rdf yielded a very scattered graph which lines that dont indicate any particular phase for the material. The 3D visualization of the system seems very similar to the last method. These differences occur as the system has not been equilibrated well. It does not make sense to have non zero values close to zero distance because atoms will never be this close due to repuslion. 

4. One of the differences I noticed was that the starting energy is much lower for this density at 235 units. The rdf represents more of a gas phase system with an initial high peak with almost no peaks after that as distance increases. I personally did not notice much difference in the 3D visualization but I am assuming that the values are actually farther from each other. 

5. I repeated the conditions in 4 at temperature 0.009. In this case, the starting temperature was much higher at 500000 units but reduces drastically at 10,000 steps. The rdf is similar to example 4 but the little peaks in the graph look a little more amplified. The visualization looked essentially the same as #4 to me.
